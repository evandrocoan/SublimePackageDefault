# Default.sublime-package (downstream fork)

I use this repository for versioning some files of the Sublime Text default packages
`Default.sublime-package` over git using two repositories strategy:

1. The first repository is mirror of some files I need to change from the latest Sublime Text
   development build version I am using. Every time a new development version is released, and I
   install it, I would unpack it, replace the files on this repository with them and commit its
   changes to this repository. This is a repository just for mirroring them. Would never be send
   changes back to this upstream from a fork repository as at every new release of Sublime Text,
   this mirror (upstream) files would be replaced and any changes would be lost lost.

1. The second repository would be a fork of this upstream mirror, on it would be included changes to
   the files at upstream mirror of Sublime Text default packages `Default.sublime-package`. Every
   Sublime Text development release would be merged the changes from the upstream mirror, if any.
   Therefore we can keep our changes while staying up-to-date with the latest version of
   `Default.sublime-package`.
